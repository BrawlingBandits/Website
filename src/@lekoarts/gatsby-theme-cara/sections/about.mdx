## About Me

Im a geeky guy who loves to code. I love to learn new things and explore new technologies. I am a self taught Full Stack Developer, currently diving deeper into Backend.

I usually go [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) for backend , [python](https://python.org) for mini projects and simple plain old [html](https://w3schools.com/) for frontend.
